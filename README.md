# Versify 

I built this app with the help of Claude so that I can memorize poetry.

https://gulley.github.io/Versify/

## To do

- Bug: problems with dashes, as in "Echoing behind us - listen". Can get into a locked state.
- Don't make me type in punctuation marks. Fill them in for me.
- Handle the blank lines between stanzas
- Completion slider should go in the text input area
- Make sure the line being filled in is always visible on the screen
- Add a timer
- Record mistyped letters
- Save time and mistypes
- Plot time and mistype progress for the same poem

## Done
- Bug: Settings Hint delay time slider is not smooth
- Bug: when I first open settings after loading the app, it doesn't reflect the state of the app. The dots are showing, but the Show Dots checkbox isn't set.
- Bug: you don't get a hint at the very beginning
- Text entry area should have the same font as the poem display area.
- Make it optional to show the original clear text on the side. With associated settings option checkbox. Default value is false.
- Bug: typing the wrong letter can trigger a look-ahead for that letter somewhere in the poem
- Bug: "tworoads" matches "two roads" when it shouldn't
- Put a "starter poem" in at initialization time
- Bug: cards should always be light colored for readability contrast
- Typing slash "/" should move focus to text input region
- Settings: Hint delay time slider should honor increments of 0.1 sec
- Prevent the wrong letter from appearing in the text input region
- At the completion of the poem (100%) the page background should darken and the text should darken (resets to default colors after load or reload).
- Hint letter should be a different color. Maybe pink.
- Get tooltips for icons
- Get rid of percent progress number
