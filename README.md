# Versify

I built this app with the help of Claude so that I can memorize poetry.

Currently working on an improved version in the Simplify branch.

## To do
- Add a "Hide Dots" checkbox. For the extra difficulty of no prompting.
- URL that opens up to a particular poem.
- Tracking of when you have completed each poem.
- Load poems from the repo, not from the local drive.
