Christmas Prayer
by Fra Giovanni  
  
I am your friend, and my love for you goes deep.
There is nothing I can give you which you have not;
But there is much, very much, that, while I cannot give,
You can take.

No heaven can come to us unless our hearts
Find rest in today. Take Heaven!
No peace lies in the future which is not hidden
In this present little instant. Take Peace!

The gloom of the world is but a shadow.
Behind it, yet within our reach, is Joy. Take Joy!

And so, at this Christmas time, I greet you, 
With the prayer that for you, now and forever, 
The day breaks and the shadows flee away.
