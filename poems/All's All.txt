All's All
by A.R. Ammons

A construed entity too  
lessened to syllabify;  
a mite or mote  
dimpling  
domy generalization;  
a vague locus  
(the flow of air  

through prisons)  
a puff of  
the whiff of  
when a snail falls asleep;  
stringy recollections of  
fruit flies cruising  
rosy bowlsful of  

mangoes ripening mild:  
ghostly leavings leaving  
ghosts leave: retinal  
worms empurpling  
light scars  
behind today's views;  
bits of  

retrenched nothings:  
so much so,  
little and all  
alternately disappear:  
the tiniest kiss  
at the world's end  
ends the world.
